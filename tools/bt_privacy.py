"""Linux only: turns Bluetooth privacy on while a watch pairs, then off again (André,
2026-10-26: "do it but document it well on the read me").

Why: with BlueZ's default `Privacy = off` the kernel gives the watch no identity when
pairing (net/bluetooth/smp.c adds SMP_DIST_ID_KEY only with HCI_PRIVACY). The Ambit3 then
files the pairing under MAC 00:00:00:00:00:00 - read off André's Peak over USB - and refuses
the computer once the link drops. Paired with privacy on, the watch keeps the computer's real
address, and reconnects work afterwards with privacy off again (verified on the Peak,
2026-10-26: reconnected without a code after a drop and a reboot).

Changing privacy needs root and a powered-off adapter, so one `pkexec` prompt runs a short
bash script as root: privacy on (unless it already is), then it waits on its stdin; a line or
EOF (Sommet quitting) or 30 minutes turns privacy off again. Each change switches Bluetooth
off for about a second, so a mouse or keyboard reconnects.

    ./tools/bt_privacy.py check     -> {"ok", "needed", "reason"}   (read-only)
    ./tools/bt_privacy.py window    turn it on, wait for Enter, turn it off (by hand)
